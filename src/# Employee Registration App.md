## Code Overview

The app consists of the following files:

* `app.js`: This is the main file of the app. It sets up the Express app and defines the routes.
* `model/model.js`: This file defines the schema for the employee data.
* `db/db.js`: This file establishes the connection to the MongoDB database.
* `template/views/index.hbs`: This is the Handlebars template for the home page.

### app.js

The `app.js` file is the entry point of the app. It sets up the Express app and defines the routes.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

let port = 3000;
const path = require('path');
const empCollection = require('./model/model');

const template_path = path.join(__dirname, '../template/views')

app.set('view engine', 'hbs');
app.set('views', template_path); 

app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: false}));

require('./db/db');

app.get('/', (req, res)=> {
    res.render('index');
})
